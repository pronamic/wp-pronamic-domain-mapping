The Pronamic Domain Mapping plugin allows you to map domains to custom domain name pages.

== Description ==

With the Pronamic Domain Mapping plugin you can easily publish a page on the 
domain aliases or pointers of your hosting solution. This way you can easily 
publish landinspages on the extra domain names you own.

= WordPress Network =

If you work with an WordPress Network and want to enable domain pages you have
to add the following line to your /wp-content/sunrise.php file.

`
$file = WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/plugins/pronamic-domain-mapping/sunrise.php'; 
if ( is_readable( $file ) ) {
	include $file;
}
`


== Installation ==

1. Extract the ZIP-file and upload the contents to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory of your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin from the *Plugins* page
3. Create a new domain name page by clicking **Add New** in the **Domain Name Pages** menu
4. Enter the domain for which this page should be shown in the field **Domain Name**

To actually visit the just added domain name page, you need to make sure the domain is configured to show your WordPress site. To test the domain name page, just visit the domain for which you're creating the domain name page. If you don't see the domain name page, follow the instructions below if your host uses either the cPanel, Plesk or DirectAdmin control panel to link the domain to your main domain (which is running the WordPress installation).

= Adding a Parked Domain in cPanel =

1. Login to the cPanel control panel
2. Go to "Parked Domains" in the "Domains" section
3. In the section "Create a New Parked Domain", enter the domain of the domain name page and click "Add Domain" (domain root should be the same as your main website and redirection should be disabled for the parked domain)
4. The domain name page should now be shown when you visit the parked domain, but it might take up to 24 hours for changes to take effect.

= Creating a Domain Alias in Plesk =

1. Login to the Plesk control panel
2. Run the "Add New Domain Alias" wizard in the "Websites & Domains" tab
3. Specify the domain for which you are creating an alias (the primary domain) and the alias’s domain name
4. Make sure the web service is enabled for the domain alias
5. The domain name page should now be shown when you visit the domain alias, but it might take up to 24 hours for changes to take effect.

= Creating a Domain Pointer in DirectAdmin =
1. Login to the DirectAdmin control panel
2. Go to "Domain Pointers" in the "Advanced Features" section
4. Specify the domain for which you are creating a pointer (the primary domain) and the pointer’s domain name
5. The domain name page should now be shown when you visit the domain pointer, but it might take up to 24 hours for changes to take effect.

If you are unable to visit the domain page after you've configured the domain correctly in the control panel of your host, make sure that the name servers for the new domain are the same as the name servers of the primary domain.
